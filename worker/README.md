# Worker

Should be as simple as possible

Jobs:
- Ask server for something to do (server will reply with details)
- Download project files if they are not already cached
- Render specific chunk or frame
- Send image component back to server
- Repeat


Notes:

Needs to be able to be aware of its own storage capacity, delete old/unused cached projects to free space
