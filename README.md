# Renderfarm
Complete blender renderfarm. School project.

Centralized system where user uploads .blend file and assets to the master computer, and master computer asks slaves to render specific frames individually. Slave then returns image and once animation is complete frames are stitched into the completed animation.

The intended devices are a collection of old Mini PCs, however this will theoretically work on anything
